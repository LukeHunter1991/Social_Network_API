## Description

In this program I built the back end to a social media platform. This allows a user to run Get, Post, Put, and Delete routes using insomnia. This will allow a user to view, create, update and delete users, and posts called 'thoughts'. A user can also add friends to a user and reactions to a thought. I did this to gain a deeper understanding of MongoDB and Mongoose.
