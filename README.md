 ## Description
 I created a web application where I cann add and remove notes. I did this so that I can easily track pending tasks that I need to complete and  leave myself general reminders. I did this to support  my time management as  I  juggle my time between my job and  study. I also wanted to gain a deeper understanding of bulding and deploying web apps.

## Installation
No installation needed. This is hosted on the web.

## Usage
To record a note, simply type a title and some text to describe the task/reminder. In the top right corner two buttons will appear - 'Save Note' and 'Clear Form'. Use the clear form button to delete any text that you have input for a note, but have not yet submitted. Once you have succesfully added a title and text use the save button to record the note. It will now appear on the left hand column along with any other notes that you have saved. Todelete a note simply click the corresponding delete button.
